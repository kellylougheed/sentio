Sentio analyzes texts for positive & negative sentiments and word frequency using the Natural Language Toolkit. Text can be imported through file upload, URL, or user entry.

## NLTK Tutorial

My tutorial [Coding & English Lit: Natural Language Processing in Python for Beginners](https://medium.com/@kellylougheed/coding-english-lit-natural-language-processing-in-python-ba8ebae4dde3) introduces new programmers to language processing by analyzing Wuthering Heights (both the book by Emily Bronte and the Kate Bush song).

Much of the code discussed in the tutorial is available in the *sample_code.py* file. The tutorial also reads and analyzes **katebush.txt**, a file in this repo.
